        <h1 class="weavingtext"> Harakeke (Flax) is unique to New Zealand and is one of our most ancient plant species. 
            When our ancestors arrived to New Zealand they quickly discovered that flax could be woven to make clothing, housing materials and decorative tūrapa (panels) for their houses. Two native species of flax both come from the lily family. Harakeke (common flax) grows up to <em>three meters high</em> and has firm, long leaves with a fine muka fibre, ideal for all types of weaving. Wharariki (mountain flax) is found along coast lines, growing up to <em>1.6 meters</em> with softer leaves and less fibre than harakeke.

            <h1> Wooden Hand Clubs</h1>
            <p>Before Europeans and European weapons arrived in Aotearoa, Māori warfare mainly involved hand-to-hand combat. <strong>Warriors</strong> used many different hand weapons, including taiaha (fighting staffs), pouwhenua (pointed staffs), tewhatewha (axe-like staffs), tao (short spears), huata (long spears) and patu (clubs).

            <h1>Geothermal Pools</h1>
            <p>Our traditional Maori explanation of Te Whakarewarewa Geothermal Valley states that this place was one of the area’s ‘Te Pupu’ and ‘Te Hoata’, the Goddesses of Fire, emerged from the earth’s core while trying to find their brother Ngātoro-i-rangi, who was stranded on Mount Tongariro. As they rose to the surface looking for their brother, they left part of the fire they carried, creating geysers, hot springs and mud pools, creating the geothermal activity that remains today.</p>
