            <h1> Geothermal Mud Pools</h1>
            <p> The mud pools are the result of acid gases and steam that cause the decomposition of minerals (feldspars) to form a clay called kaolin. Kaolin is white when pure, but finely divided black sulphur turns it to grey. The activity varies with the amount of rainfall, but the temperature of the steaming bursts of mud is approximately 90-95 degrees Celsius (194-203 degrees Fahrenheit).

            <h1> The Smell</h1>
            <p> That <em>“pongy”</em> smell Rotorua is famous for is due to hydrogen sulphide released by geothermal features. When released into the air, the hydrogen sulphide reacts with oxygen, creating sulphuric acid. This acid has the ability to dissolve rock into fine particles of silica and clay, and when combined with a small supply of water, a mud pool is created.

        <h1 class="weavingtext"> The main geyser is called “Pohutu” which means <em>“Big splash”</em> and erupts up to heights of 30 meters. Pohutu is semi-predictable, as she plays 15-20 minutes after   another of our active geysers. According to Maori culture, geysers are viewed as <strong>from the gods</strong> . All geysers have three components; an intensive heat source, a constant supply of water and an underground plumbing system.<br>
            As rainfall fills the intricate plumbing system below the earth’s surface, <strong>rock rapidly</strong>  heats the water.

            <h1><strong>Prince Of Wales Feathers</strong></h1>
            <p>To the left of Pohutu (when viewing from the bridge) is the <em>“Prince of Wales Feathers”</em> Geyser – named after Prince Edward Albert visited here in the 1900’s. It was traditionally named the “Tohu” or sign as it usually plays 10 mins before and then simultaneously with Pohutu and reaches heights of up to <strong>seven metres</strong> (almost 23 feet). <br> The “Kererū” Geyser erupts every few days from the blackened crater closest to Puarenga Stream. The fan-shaped jet can reach heights of up to <strong>15 metres </strong>(just over 49 feet). It is named after the New Zealand Pigeon.</p>

            <h1> Maori explanation</h1>
            <p>Our traditional Maori explanation of Te Whakarewarewa Geothermal Valley states that this place was one of the area’s ‘Te Pupu’ and ‘Te Hoata’, the Goddesses of Fire, <strong>emerged</strong> from the earth’s core while trying to find their brother Ngātoro-i-rangi, who was stranded on Mount Tongariro.<br> As they rose to the surface looking for their brother, they left part of the fire they carried, creating geysers, hot springs and mud pools, creating the geothermal activity that remains today.
